<br>
The dataset is credited to Hipel an Mcleod, 1994.
<br>
<br>
Background: The Dataset provides the annual water usage in Baltimore from 1885 to 1963, or 79 years of data. The values are in the units of liters per capita per day, and there are 79 observations.
<br>
<br>
Objective: Create a python script for the Use Case below, please upload the script after you ﬁnish. The Problem is to predict annual water usage.
<br>
<br>
Consists of 2 files:
1. ANNUAL WATER USAGE IN BALTIMORE: A python script to predict annual water usage in Baltimore.
2. water.csv: Dataset file
<br>

## 2. Question 2
Dataset: Apartment Price in Victoria.
<br>
You can download it here. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1j8TdXtCnEQlqn2esDbiuPay01pDooS-w 
<br>
<br>
Background: The Dataset provides living area and conservation status. There are 218 observations and 16 variables.
<br>
<br>
Objective: Create a python script for the Use Case below, please upload the script after you ﬁnish. The Problem is to determine the best model and give the reason. Tony who has profession as a broker wants to predict apartment price in Victoria based on living area environment and apartment conservation status. Determine the best model to predict and redeﬁne new conservation variable in 3 level, A = 1A, B = 2A, C = 2B and 3A.
